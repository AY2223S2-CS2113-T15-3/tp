## Design

{Describe the design and implementation of the product. Use UML diagrams and short code snippets where applicable.}

### Architecture

<img src="images\ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="300" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. 

Given below is a quick overview of how each component interact with each other.

The main components in the architecture are:

* `MoneyMind`: The main program of the application, 
it initializes the other components in the correct sequence and is responsible for shut down the application.
* `UI`: The user interface of the application.
* `Storage`: The storage of data of the application.
* `Data`: The data classes used in the application, including Event, Category and CategoryList.
* `Command`: The command of the application, including AddCommand, DeleteCommand, ListCommand, etc.

<img src="images\ArchitectureSequence.png" width="500" />

The *sequence diagram* above shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario 
where the user issues the command `event buy lunch e/10`.

The following sections will explain the architecture in more detail.

### Storage component

**API**: `Storage.java`

{UML class diagram}

The `Storage` component,
* can save category and event data in txt format, and read it back. (txt format is chosen because it is human readable)
* depends on `CategoryList.java` and `CategoryCommand.java` to save and load data from ArrayList and HashMap.

### Commands component

**API**: `Command.java`

{UML class diagram}

The `Command` component,
* can execute different commands, such as adding category, adding event, deleting category, deleting event, viewing category, viewing event
* depends on `CategoryList.java`, `CategoryCommand.java`, `Event.java`, `Parser.java` to execute the commands.

### Parser component

**API**: `Parser.java`

{UML class diagram}

The `Parser` component,
* can parse the user input and process it to the correct format
* depends on `CategoryList.java`, `CategoryCommand.java`, `Event.java`, `Command.java` to execute the commands.

## Implementation
This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.
  
## Appendix A: Product Scope
### Target user profile

## Appendix C: Non Functional Requirements

1. MoneyMind should work on any mainstream OS as long as it has Java 11 or above installed.
2. The user is expected to be a fast-typer. MoneyMind is not optimised for users that are not 
used to CLI applications.
3. The user is expected to have a good habit of constantly and systematically recording their
expenses. MoneyMind is not optimised for users that only record their expense on ad-hoc basis.
4. Other than the above, please enjoy using MoneyMind!

It can be a one time expense like buying a pair of sneakers or recurring expenses like
electricity bills.
*  *category* - A category is a group of events that are related to each other. For example,

*  *recurring expense* - An expense that occurs repeatedly, in the context of MoneyMind, the
frequency is set to monthly.
